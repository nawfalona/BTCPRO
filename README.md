This extension displays the current btc price on the badge icon.
Super light weight minimalist extension that displays the current Bitcoin price in USD pulled using blockchaincom's api. just 69 lines of well optimized code ;)
 ps: doesn't require any permissions
 ps2: will move to a better API soon in the next update.
